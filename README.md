M3Foundation 0.9999999999â€¦
============
M3Foundation is a collection of categories and classes that extend and enhance the Foundation framework. This functionality is taken from various M Cubed applications.

As the version number suggests this is effectively 1.0, so the interfaces shouldn't change, but I do want to add some more tests, convert it to ARC and tidy up some source before I officially declare it 1.0

M3Foundation includes the following:
- Simplified access for arrays and dictionaries
- performBlock:withSelector: methods
- Replace the implementation of a method on a single object
- Bulk KVO operations
- Simplified XML access
- Conversion of predicates and expressions to and from XML
- An Objective-C interface to the accessibility API
- Value transformers for file sizes and CSV strings
- A deterministic finite automata class
- A NSOperation subclass for URL connections
And more

M3Foundation requires Lion and Xcode 4.2+
